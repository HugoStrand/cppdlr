`cppdlr` is a C++ library implementing the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) of
imaginary time single-particle Green's functions and other imaginary time
quantities. For more information on the DLR, see the references below.

Please see [the documentation](https://flatironinstitute.github.io/cppdlr/) for more information about `cppdlr`.

Libraries implementing the DLR are available in other languages:

- Python, via [pydlr](https://github.com/jasonkaye/libdlr)
- Fortran, via [libdlr](https://github.com/jasonkaye/libdlr)
- Julia, via [Lehmann.jl](https://github.com/numericaleft/Lehmann.jl)
