Reporting issues
****************

Please report all problems and bugs on the GitHub issues page
`<https://github.com/flatironinstitute/cppdlr/issues>`_, following these guidelines:

#. In all cases specify which version of ``cppdlr`` you are using. You can
   find the version number in the file :file:`CMakeLists.txt` at the root of the
   application sources.

#. If you have a problem during the installation, give us information about
   your operating system and the compiler you are using. Include the outputs of
   the ``cmake`` and ``make`` commands as well as the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file
   which is in the build directory. Please include these outputs in a
   `gist <http://gist.github.com/>`_ file referenced in the issue.

#. If you are experiencing a problem during the execution of the application, provide
   a script which allows us to quickly reproduce the problem.
